# Rabbit Rabbit

Rabbit Rabbit enables users to generate workouts for their Garmin devices.

You can ask Rabbit Rabbit to build you a running workout based on your goals - something like, "Build me a speed workout with an 800m warmup, a 2 mile run at 6:45 pace, and a 1 mile cooldown."

Rabbit Rabbit integrates with the Garmin API and uses Supabase to store user data and workouts. In the future, we may integrate with other platforms as well.

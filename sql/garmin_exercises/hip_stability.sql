VALUES ('HIP_STABILITY', 'BAND_SIDE_LYING_LEG_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hips,hip abductors,gluteus medius}', '{resistance band}', 'A side-lying leg raise with resistance band around legs or ankles. Lie on your side and lift the top leg against band resistance. This exercise targets the gluteus medius and minimus - critical muscles for hip stability, knee alignment, and injury prevention. The band provides constant tension throughout the movement. Essential for runners, athletes, and anyone wanting strong, stable hips.');

VALUES ('HIP_STABILITY', 'DEAD_BUG', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,hip flexors,stability}', '{bodyweight}', 'A fundamental core stability exercise - lie on your back, extend opposite arm and leg while keeping lower back flat. The name comes from the position resembling a dead bug on its back. This exercise teaches anti-extension core control, coordinates opposite limbs, and builds deep core stability. Essential for lower back health and functional movement. One of the best exercises for core stability and preventing lower back pain.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('HIP_STABILITY', 'EXTERNAL_HIP_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hips,hip abductors,external rotators}', '{bodyweight}', 'A hip raise with external rotation - lift the leg while rotating it outward. This targets the hip external rotators (deep six muscles including piriformis) and gluteus medius. These muscles are crucial for hip stability, proper gait mechanics, and preventing knee valgus. Excellent for addressing hip weakness and improving movement quality. Important for injury prevention and athletic performance.');

VALUES ('HIP_STABILITY', 'FIRE_HYDRANT_KICKS', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hips,hip abductors,gluteus medius}', '{bodyweight}', 'From hands and knees, lift one leg out to the side (like a dog at a fire hydrant), then extend with a kicking motion. This exercise targets the gluteus medius and hip abductors through abduction and extension. The name comes from the distinctive sideways leg position. Excellent for hip stability, glute activation, and improving lateral hip strength. Popular in physical therapy and functional training.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('HIP_STABILITY', 'HIP_CIRCLES', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hips,hip abductors,core,mobility}', '{bodyweight}', 'Circular hip movements performed standing or from quadruped position. Rotate the leg in large circles, working through the full range of hip motion. This exercise improves hip mobility, activates all hip muscles in multiple planes, and enhances coordination. The circular motion trains the hip through flexion, extension, abduction, and rotation. Excellent warm-up exercise and for improving hip function.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('HIP_STABILITY', 'INNER_THIGH_LIFT', 'STRENGTH', '{hips,hip adductors,inner thighs}', '{bodyweight}', 'Lie on your side with bottom leg straight and top leg crossed over. Lift the bottom (inner) leg off the ground. This isolates the hip adductors (inner thigh muscles including adductor longus, brevis, and magnus). These muscles are often neglected but crucial for hip stability, athletic performance, and injury prevention. Excellent for building inner thigh strength and balanced hip development.');

VALUES ('HIP_STABILITY', 'LATERAL_WALKS_WITH_BAND_AT_ANKLES', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hips,hip abductors,gluteus medius}', '{resistance band}', 'Lateral band walks - place resistance band around ankles, maintain athletic stance, and walk sideways. This exercise is one of the most effective for activating the gluteus medius and hip abductors. The constant tension prevents knee collapse and builds lateral hip strength. Essential for athletes, runners, and anyone with knee issues. Widely used in physical therapy and sports performance training.');

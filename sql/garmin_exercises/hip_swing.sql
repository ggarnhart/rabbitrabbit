VALUES ('HIP_SWING', 'ONE_ARM_SWING', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hamstrings,hips,core,power,unilateral,hinge pattern}', '{kettlebell}', 'A single-arm kettlebell swing performed with one hand while the other is free or on the hip. This unilateral variation increases grip demands, challenges anti-rotation core strength, and allows for higher swing volume per arm. The asymmetric loading creates significant core stability demands and helps identify strength imbalances.');

VALUES ('HIP_SWING', 'SINGLE_ARM_DUMBBELL_SWING', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hamstrings,hips,core,power,unilateral,hinge pattern}', '{dumbbells}', 'A kettlebell swing pattern performed with a single dumbbell held in one hand. While not as smooth as a kettlebell due to the weight distribution, dumbbell swings still effectively develop hip power, posterior chain strength, and cardiovascular conditioning. The single-arm loading challenges grip and core stability.');

VALUES ('HIP_SWING', 'SINGLE_ARM_KETTLEBELL_SWING', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hamstrings,hips,core,power,unilateral,hinge pattern}', '{kettlebell}', 'A fundamental kettlebell exercise performed with one arm. Explosively drive the hips forward to swing the kettlebell from between the legs to chest height. This ballistic movement develops posterior chain power, grip strength, cardiovascular conditioning, and anti-rotation core stability. Can be alternated between arms or performed in sets per side.');

VALUES ('HIP_SWING', 'STEP_OUT_SWING', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hamstrings,hips,core,power,hinge pattern,lateral movement}', '{kettlebell}', 'A kettlebell swing variation where you step laterally (out to the side) as you swing. This adds a lateral movement component to the traditional swing pattern, increasing leg involvement and challenging stability in multiple planes. Excellent for athletes requiring multi-directional power and agility.');

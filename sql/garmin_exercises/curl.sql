VALUES ('CURL', 'ALTERNATING_DUMBBELL_BICEPS_CURL', 'STRENGTH', '{biceps,arms}', '{dumbbells}', 'A dumbbell bicep curl performed by alternating arms - curl one dumbbell up while the other is at rest. This variation allows for slightly heavier weight per arm and helps identify strength imbalances. The alternating pattern also increases time under tension. Excellent for building bicep size and strength while maintaining strict form.');

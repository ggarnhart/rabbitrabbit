VALUES ('CARRY', 'BAR_HOLDS', 'STRENGTH', '{grip,forearms,back,core,carry,isometric}', '{barbell}', 'An isometric hold where a loaded barbell is gripped and held statically, typically in a deadlift position. This exercise builds massive grip strength, forearm endurance, and total-body stability. Can be held at various heights or during the lockout of a deadlift. Essential for improving grip strength for pulling exercises.');

VALUES ('CARRY', 'DUMBBELL_WAITER_CARRY', 'STRENGTH', '{shoulders,core,stability,carry,grip,unilateral}', '{dumbbells}', 'A single-arm overhead carry where a dumbbell is held like a waiter carrying a tray - arm fully extended overhead with elbow locked out and palm facing up. This challenges shoulder stability, core anti-lateral flexion, and grip strength. Excellent for building overhead strength and stability.');

VALUES ('CARRY', 'FARMERS_CARRY', 'STRENGTH', '{grip,forearms,core,traps,full body,carry}', '{dumbbells}', 'A loaded carry exercise where heavy weights (dumbbells, kettlebells, or farmer''s walk handles) are held at the sides while walking. This fundamental carry builds grip strength, core stability, trap development, and total-body strength. One of the most functional exercises for real-world strength and conditioning.');

VALUES ('CARRY', 'FARMERS_CARRY_ON_TOES', 'STRENGTH', '{grip,forearms,core,traps,calves,carry,balance}', '{dumbbells}', 'A farmer''s carry variation performed while walking on the toes (plantar flexed ankles). This adds a significant calf and ankle stability challenge while maintaining all the grip and core benefits of standard farmer''s carries. Excellent for developing calf endurance and ankle stability under load.');

VALUES ('CARRY', 'FARMERS_WALK', 'STRENGTH', '{grip,forearms,core,traps,full body,carry}', '{dumbbells}', 'Another name for farmer''s carry. Walking while holding heavy weights at the sides. This exercise builds functional, real-world strength including grip endurance, core stability, trap development, and mental toughness. A staple in strongman training and excellent for overall strength development.');

VALUES ('CARRY', 'FARMERS_WALK_ON_TOES', 'STRENGTH', '{grip,forearms,core,traps,calves,carry,balance}', '{dumbbells}', 'Farmer''s walk performed while staying up on the toes throughout the movement. This variation significantly increases calf engagement and challenges balance while maintaining the grip and core benefits. The elevated position also increases time under tension for the calves.');

VALUES ('CARRY', 'HEX_DUMBBELL_HOLD', 'STRENGTH', '{grip,forearms,shoulders,core,carry,isometric}', '{dumbbells}', 'An isometric hold where a hexagonal dumbbell is gripped by the weighted ends (not the handle) and held in various positions - typically in front of the body, overhead, or at the sides. This pinch-grip variation maximally challenges thumb and finger strength. Excellent for building crushing grip strength.');

VALUES ('CARRY', 'OVERHEAD_CARRY', 'STRENGTH', '{shoulders,core,stability,carry,grip}', '{dumbbells}', 'A carry variation where weight is held overhead with arms fully extended while walking. This can be performed with one or two arms and challenges shoulder stability, core anti-extension strength, and overhead mobility. Excellent for building shoulder endurance and stability for overhead pressing and Olympic lifts.');

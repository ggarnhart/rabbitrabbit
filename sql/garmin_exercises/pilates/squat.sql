VALUES ('SQUAT', 'PILATES_PLIE_SQUATS_PARALLEL_TURNED_OUT_FLAT_AND_HEELS', 'PILATES', '{back,legs,quads,squat pattern}', '{bodyweight}', 'A controlled Pilates squat performed with feet either parallel or turned out, heels firmly planted on the ground. This exercise engages the quadriceps, glutes, and lower back while emphasizing proper spinal alignment and core stability. The movement is slow and controlled, focusing on quality of motion and muscle engagement rather than speed, making it ideal for building strength and improving posture.');

VALUES ('SQUAT', 'RELEVE_STRAIGHT_LEG_AND_KNEE_BENT_WITH_ONE_LEG_VARIATION', 'PILATES', '{legs,quads,squat pattern,unilateral}', '{bodyweight}', 'An advanced single-leg Pilates exercise combining a releve (rising onto the balls of the foot) with one leg while the other leg remains straight. One leg bends into a squat position while the other stays extended, requiring significant strength, balance, and core stability. This unilateral movement isolates each leg, improves bilateral strength differences, enhances proprioception, and targets the quadriceps, glutes, and stabilizing muscles of the working leg.');

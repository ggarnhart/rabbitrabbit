VALUES ('PLANK', 'BRIDGE_ONE_LEG_BRIDGE', 'PILATES', '{core,abs,unilateral,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'An advanced single-leg bridge variation where one leg lifts while the body remains in a bridge position. This challenging unilateral movement powerfully targets the glutes, core, and stabilizing muscles while building exceptional strength and balance.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('PLANK', 'BRIDGE_WITH_GLUTE_LOWER_LIFT', 'PILATES', '{glutes,hips,core,abs,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'A bridge variation with an additional lower lift movement of the hips. This dynamic-static combination intensely engages the glutes, core, and hip stabilizers while building exceptional strength.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('PLANK', 'PLANK', 'PILATES', '{core,abs,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'The foundational isometric exercise performed in a horizontal position supported by arms and toes. This powerful movement builds exceptional core, shoulder, and full-body strength through sustained contraction.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('PLANK', 'PLANK_WITH_ARM_VARIATIONS', 'PILATES', '{core,abs,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'A plank variation with dynamic arm movements like reaching, circles, or reaches. These arm movements add instability and increase core demands while building shoulder strength.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('PLANK', 'PLANK_WITH_LEG_LIFT', 'PILATES', '{core,abs,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'A dynamic plank variation where you alternate lifting legs while maintaining the plank position. This movement adds instability and increases core, glute, and hip demands.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('PLANK', 'REVERSE_PLANK_WITH_LEG_PULL', 'PILATES', '{core,abs,pull,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'A reverse plank variation where you pull the legs or knees toward the chest dynamically. This challenging exercise strengthens the posterior chain, core, and improves spinal mobility.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('PLANK', 'SIDE_PLANK', 'PILATES', '{core,abs,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'An oblique-focused isometric exercise performed lying on your side supported by one arm. This challenging movement builds lateral core strength, improves spinal stability, and strengthens the shoulders and hips.');

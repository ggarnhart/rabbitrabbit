VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', '_3_WAY_WEIGHTED_SINGLE_LEG_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs,unilateral}', '{dumbbells}', 'The most challenging calf raise variation, combining single-leg balance, three foot positions, and added weight. This exercise maximally develops calf strength, ankle stability, and balance while ensuring both legs develop equally.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'DONKEY_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs}', '{bodyweight}', 'Performed by bending forward at the hips (roughly 90 degrees) with hands supported and raising onto the toes. The bent-over position creates an optimal stretch on the gastrocnemius muscle, allowing for greater range of motion and muscle activation compared to standard standing calf raises.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SEATED_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs}', '{bodyweight}', 'Performed while seated with knees bent at 90 degrees, placing the resistance on the knees. This position specifically targets the soleus muscle (the deeper calf muscle) since the bent knee position reduces gastrocnemius involvement. Essential for complete calf development.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SEATED_DUMBBELL_TOE_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs}', '{dumbbells}', 'A seated calf raise variation where dumbbells rest on the knees to provide resistance. The seated position with bent knees emphasizes the soleus muscle. This is excellent for building lower calf mass and improving ankle plantar flexion strength.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SINGLE_LEG_BENT_KNEE_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs,unilateral}', '{bodyweight}', 'A single-leg calf raise performed with the knee slightly bent, targeting the soleus muscle while also challenging balance and stability. The bent knee reduces gastrocnemius activation and places greater emphasis on the deeper soleus, making it complementary to standing variations.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SINGLE_LEG_DECLINE_PUSH_UP', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,triceps,shoulders,calves,legs,unilateral,push}', '{bodyweight}', 'A decline push-up performed with one leg elevated, combining upper body pressing with single-leg calf stability. The elevated leg must maintain a calf raise position throughout the push-up, creating an isometric calf challenge alongside the dynamic chest and triceps work.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SINGLE_LEG_DONKEY_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs,unilateral}', '{bodyweight}', 'A donkey calf raise performed on one leg while bent forward at the hips. This advanced variation combines the stretched position benefits of the donkey calf raise with unilateral loading, significantly increasing the challenge and helping to correct strength imbalances between legs.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SINGLE_LEG_HIP_RAISE_WITH_KNEE_HOLD', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hips,calves,legs,unilateral,isometric}', '{bodyweight}', 'A single-leg glute bridge where the non-working leg is held at the knee in a tucked position, while the planted foot performs an isometric calf raise. This exercise simultaneously targets the glutes, hamstrings, and calves while challenging core stability and balance.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SINGLE_LEG_STANDING_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs,unilateral}', '{bodyweight}', 'The classic single-leg calf raise performed while standing. This unilateral exercise doubles the load on each calf compared to bilateral raises, improves ankle stability and balance, and helps identify and correct strength imbalances. Can be performed on a step for increased range of motion.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'SINGLE_LEG_STANDING_DUMBBELL_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs,unilateral}', '{dumbbells}', 'A single-leg standing calf raise performed while holding a dumbbell for added resistance. The combination of unilateral loading and external weight significantly increases muscle activation and strength development. The non-working hand can hold a support for balance.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'STANDING_BARBELL_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs}', '{barbell}', 'A standing calf raise performed with a barbell across the upper back, similar to a squat position. This variation allows for heavy loading of the calves and emphasizes the gastrocnemius muscle. The barbell position also engages core stabilizers to maintain upright posture.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CALF_RAISE', 'STANDING_CALF_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{calves,legs}', '{bodyweight}', 'The fundamental calf exercise performed by rising onto the toes from a standing position. Primarily targets the gastrocnemius muscle. Most effective when performed on a step or elevated surface to allow the heel to drop below toe level, maximizing range of motion and muscle stretch.');

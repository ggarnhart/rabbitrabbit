INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('SLED', 'BACKWARD_DRAG', 'STRENGTH', '{quads,legs,back,grip,functional}', '{sled}', 'Pulling a weighted sled while walking or running backward. Attach the sled to a harness or hold straps while moving in reverse, forcing the quads to work eccentrically and the upper back to maintain posture. Excellent for building quad strength, improving deceleration ability, and developing pulling strength. Low eccentric stress makes it great for high-volume training.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('SLED', 'CHEST_PRESS', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,triceps,shoulders,legs,push,full body}', '{sled}', 'Pushing a sled with arms extended in front in a pressing position, similar to a standing chest press. Drive through the legs while maintaining constant pressure through the arms. This variation emphasizes the chest, shoulders, and triceps while still requiring leg drive. Builds pushing endurance and upper body strength.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('SLED', 'FORWARD_DRAG', 'STRENGTH', '{back,legs,grip,pulling,functional}', '{sled}', 'Pulling a weighted sled forward while walking or running. Attach to a harness or hold straps and lean forward to drag the sled. This movement builds total-body pulling strength, leg drive, grip endurance, and cardiovascular conditioning. The concentric-only nature allows for high training volume without excessive soreness.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('SLED', 'LOW_PUSH', 'STRENGTH', '{legs,quads,glutes,calves,power,full body}', '{sled}', 'Pushing a sled with hands positioned low on the uprights, creating a forward lean and lower body position. This variation maximizes leg involvement and mimics a sprint start position. Develops explosive leg drive, acceleration mechanics, and lower body power. A staple for speed development and athletic conditioning.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('SLED', 'PUSH', 'STRENGTH', '{legs,quads,glutes,calves,shoulders,full body}', '{sled}', 'The fundamental sled exercise - pushing a loaded sled forward with hands on the uprights. Drive through the legs while maintaining forward pressure on the sled. Builds leg strength, cardiovascular conditioning, and mental toughness. The lack of eccentric loading allows for frequent training and high volume without excessive muscle damage.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('SLED', 'ROW', 'STRENGTH', '{back,lats,biceps,legs,pulling,full body}', '{sled}', 'A rowing movement using a sled, typically performed by standing and pulling the sled toward you using straps or a rope hand-over-hand. Each pull brings the sled closer while you maintain position or walk backward. Builds back strength, grip endurance, and total-body conditioning. Excellent for high-rep pulling work without eccentric damage.');

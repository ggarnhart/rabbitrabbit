VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'BAND_GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,hinge pattern}', '{resistance band}', 'Good morning exercise using resistance band for resistance. Stand on band, hold other end at shoulders, hinge at hips while keeping back straight. The band provides accommodating resistance - increasing tension as you rise. This hip hinge movement targets the posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, spinal erectors). Excellent for teaching proper hinge mechanics and building hamstring strength. Great alternative when barbells are unavailable.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'BAR_GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,hinge pattern}', '{barbell}', 'The classic barbell good morning - a fundamental posterior chain exercise. Bar rests on upper back (like a squat), hinge forward at hips while maintaining neutral spine, then return to standing. This movement builds exceptional hamstring, glute, and lower back strength. Essential for developing the hip hinge pattern and posterior chain. The name comes from the bowing motion resembling a morning greeting. Strengthens the entire backside.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,hinge pattern}', '{bodyweight}', 'Bodyweight good morning - the foundational hip hinge movement pattern. Stand with hands behind head or crossed at chest, hinge forward at hips while keeping back neutral. This fundamental movement teaches proper hinge mechanics essential for deadlifts and daily activities. Builds hamstring and glute flexibility and strength. Excellent warm-up exercise or teaching tool. The base pattern for all good morning variations.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'LEG_CURL', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,knee flexion,isolation}', '{leg curl machine}', 'The classic leg curl machine exercise - THE isolation movement for hamstrings. Lie face down (or sit), curl weight pad toward glutes by bending knees. This isolation exercise directly targets the hamstring muscles through knee flexion. Essential for hamstring development, knee health, and balanced leg strength. Can be performed lying, seated, or standing. One of the most effective exercises for direct hamstring work.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'SEATED_BARBELL_GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,hinge pattern}', '{barbell,bench}', 'Good morning performed while seated on a bench with barbell on upper back. Sit on bench, bar on shoulders, hinge forward from hips. The seated position removes leg drive and isolates the posterior chain. This variation emphasizes the hamstrings and lower back more than standing versions. Excellent for strict form and targeting the hamstrings. Reduces lower back strain compared to standing good mornings.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'SINGLE_LEG_BARBELL_GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,hinge pattern,unilateral,balance}', '{barbell}', 'Single-leg good morning with barbell - an advanced unilateral posterior chain exercise. Bar on shoulders, stand on one leg, hinge forward while maintaining balance. This challenging variation builds tremendous single-leg strength, balance, and stability. Addresses left-right imbalances in posterior chain development. Requires significant core strength and proprioception. Excellent for athletic performance and injury prevention.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'SINGLE_LEG_SLIDING_LEG_CURL', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,core,unilateral,stability}', '{sliding discs}', 'Single-leg hamstring curl using a sliding disc. Lie on back, one heel on slider, bridge up, curl heel toward glutes. This challenging bodyweight exercise builds hamstring strength through knee flexion and hip extension. The single-leg version creates significant core stability demands. Addresses muscular imbalances between legs. Excellent alternative to machine leg curls. Requires control and hamstring strength.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'SLIDING_LEG_CURL', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,core}', '{sliding discs}', 'A bodyweight hamstring curl using sliding discs (or towels on smooth floor). Lie on back, heels on sliders, bridge up, curl heels toward glutes. This exercise combines hip extension and knee flexion, targeting hamstrings through their full function. The unstable sliding surface requires constant control. Excellent alternative to machine leg curls. Builds functional hamstring strength and core stability. Can be made harder by elevating shoulders.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'SPLIT_BARBELL_GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,hinge pattern,unilateral}', '{barbell}', 'Good morning performed in a split stance with barbell. Bar on shoulders, one foot forward, hinge at hips. The split stance changes the loading and allows focus on one leg at a time. This variation builds single-leg posterior chain strength while maintaining more stability than full single-leg versions. Excellent for addressing imbalances and building unilateral strength. Combines benefits of split stance and hip hinge.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'SPLIT_STANCE_EXTENSION', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,hinge pattern}', '{bodyweight}', 'Hip extension movement performed in a split stance. One foot forward, hinge at hips and extend back to standing. This bodyweight variation of the hip hinge pattern allows focus on posterior chain development without equipment. The split stance provides stability while targeting hamstrings and glutes. Excellent for learning proper hinge mechanics and warming up the posterior chain. Good progression toward more advanced variations.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'STAGGERED_STANCE_GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,hinge pattern}', '{bodyweight}', 'Bodyweight good morning with staggered foot positioning - one foot slightly ahead. This stance variation challenges stability while maintaining the hip hinge pattern. The staggered stance creates slight asymmetry, engaging stabilizer muscles differently than square stance. Excellent for building balance, addressing minor imbalances, and adding variety to posterior chain training. Good teaching tool for proper hinge mechanics.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'SWISS_BALL_HIP_RAISE_AND_LEG_CURL', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,core,stability}', '{swiss ball}', 'An exceptional hamstring and glute exercise - lie on back, heels on swiss ball, bridge hips up, curl ball toward glutes. This compound movement combines hip extension and knee flexion, working hamstrings through their complete function. The unstable ball demands core stability and control. One of the best bodyweight hamstring exercises. Builds strength, stability, and muscle. Can progress to single-leg version for increased difficulty.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'WEIGHTED_LEG_CURL', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,knee flexion,isolation}', '{leg curl machine}', 'Machine leg curl with increased weight resistance. The weighted version allows progressive overload for building hamstring strength and size. This isolation movement targets the hamstrings through pure knee flexion. Essential for complete leg development and preventing quad-hamstring strength imbalances. Can be performed lying, seated, or standing. Adjust weight progressively for strength and hypertrophy gains.');

VALUES ('LEG_CURL', 'ZERCHER_GOOD_MORNING', 'STRENGTH', '{hamstrings,glutes,lower back,core,hinge pattern}', '{barbell}', 'Good morning with barbell held in the Zercher position (crook of elbows). This unique bar position shifts the center of gravity forward, increasing core demands and changing the loading pattern. The Zercher hold requires significant upper back and core strength. This variation builds exceptional posterior chain and core strength simultaneously. Advanced exercise for experienced lifters. The forward load challenges the entire trunk.');

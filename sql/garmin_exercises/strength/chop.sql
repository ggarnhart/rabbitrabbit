INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CHOP', 'CABLE_PULL_THROUGH', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hamstrings,hips,core,hinge pattern}', '{cable machine}', 'A hip hinge exercise using a cable positioned low between the legs. Pull the cable through by extending the hips, similar to a kettlebell swing but more controlled. This posterior chain exercise builds glute and hamstring strength while teaching proper hip hinge mechanics. Despite the name, this is more of a hinge than a traditional rotational chop.');

VALUES ('CHOP', 'CABLE_ROTATIONAL_LIFT', 'STRENGTH', '{core,obliques,rotation,full body}', '{cable machine}', 'A rotational movement starting low and lifting diagonally across the body to finish high (opposite of a chop). Using a cable machine, rotate from a low position on one side to an overhead position on the opposite side. Builds rotational power through the entire kinetic chain. Excellent for athletes requiring rotational strength.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'HANGING_KNEE_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,hip flexors,grip}', '{pull-up bar}', 'Hang from pull-up bar and raise knees toward chest. This fundamental core exercise targets the lower abs and hip flexors while building grip strength. The hanging position requires full-body tension and control. Easier progression than straight-leg raises. Essential for developing core strength and progressing to advanced ab exercises. Keep movement controlled, avoid excessive swinging.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'HANGING_LEG_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,hip flexors,grip}', '{pull-up bar}', 'One of the most challenging ab exercises - hang from bar and raise straight legs to horizontal or beyond. This advanced movement builds exceptional core strength and control. Targets the entire abdominal wall, especially lower abs. Requires significant hip flexor mobility and core strength. The straight-leg position makes it much harder than knee raises. Elite core development exercise.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'HANGING_SINGLE_LEG_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,hip flexors,obliques,unilateral,grip}', '{pull-up bar}', 'Single-leg variation of hanging leg raise - raise one straight leg while hanging. This unilateral version adds rotational stability demands and addresses imbalances. More challenging than it appears due to the asymmetrical loading. Engages obliques for anti-rotation control. Excellent for core strength and identifying left-right differences. Can alternate legs or complete all reps on one side.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'KETTLEBELL_LEG_RAISES', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,hip flexors,adductors}', '{kettlebell}', 'Leg raises performed while gripping a kettlebell between the feet. Lie on back or hang from bar, hold kettlebell between feet, raise legs. The kettlebell adds significant resistance and requires adductor engagement to maintain grip on the weight. This weighted variation builds exceptional core and hip flexor strength. The unstable kettlebell increases difficulty. Advanced core exercise for serious strength development.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'LEG_LOWERING_DRILL', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,hip flexors,lower back}', '{bodyweight}', 'Lie on back, raise legs to vertical, slowly lower them toward floor without letting lower back arch. This controlled eccentric exercise builds exceptional core strength and teaches proper spinal stabilization. The key is maintaining lower back contact with floor throughout. Stop lowering before back arches. Excellent for developing core control and preventing lower back pain. Used extensively in physical therapy and core training.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'REVERSE_LEG_RAISE', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hamstrings,lower back}', '{bodyweight}', 'Lie face down and raise both legs off the floor. This posterior chain exercise targets the glutes, hamstrings, and lower back. The prone position emphasizes hip extension and posterior muscles. Excellent for building lower back strength, improving posture, and activating the glutes. Can be held isometrically or performed dynamically. Good complement to traditional ab exercises for balanced core development.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'REVERSE_LEG_RAISE_ON_SWISS_BALL', 'STRENGTH', '{glutes,hamstrings,lower back,core,stability}', '{swiss ball}', 'Reverse leg raise performed while lying face down on a swiss ball. The unstable ball surface dramatically increases core stability demands compared to floor version. This variation requires constant balance and stabilization while targeting the posterior chain. Excellent for building functional strength, improving balance, and developing total body control. The instability engages deep core stabilizers.');

VALUES ('LEG_RAISE', 'SINGLE_LEG_LOWERING_DRILL', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,hip flexors,obliques,unilateral}', '{bodyweight}', 'Single-leg variation of leg lowering drill - raise one leg to vertical, slowly lower with control while keeping lower back flat. This unilateral version adds anti-rotation demands and identifies imbalances between sides. More challenging than bilateral version due to asymmetrical loading. Excellent for core stability, addressing imbalances, and building single-leg control. Keep non-working leg bent with foot on floor.');

VALUES ('CARDIO', 'BOB_AND_WEAVE_CIRCLE', 'STRENGTH', '{full body,cardio,agility,legs}', '{bodyweight}', 'A boxing-inspired footwork drill where you bob (squat down) and weave (move laterally) in a circular pattern. This dynamic movement develops lower body endurance, agility, cardiovascular fitness, and mimics defensive boxing footwork. Excellent for athletic conditioning and fight sports.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'CARDIO_CORE_CRAWL', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,shoulders,cardio,full body}', '{bodyweight}', 'A bear crawl or similar quadruped crawling pattern performed at a pace to elevate heart rate. Moving on hands and feet (or hands and knees) forward, backward, or laterally builds core strength, shoulder stability, and cardiovascular endurance. Combines strength and cardio in a functional movement.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'DOUBLE_UNDER', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,coordination,power}', '{jump rope}', 'An advanced jump rope technique where the rope passes under the feet twice during each jump. This requires explosive jumping power, rhythm, and coordination. Double unders dramatically increase cardiovascular intensity compared to single jumps and build calf and ankle power. A staple in CrossFit and boxing training.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'JUMP_ROPE', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,coordination,endurance}', '{jump rope}', 'The fundamental jump rope exercise with one rope pass per jump. An efficient cardiovascular exercise that builds calf endurance, improves coordination and rhythm, and can be performed almost anywhere. Excellent for warm-ups, cardio conditioning, and developing footwork for sports.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'JUMP_ROPE_CROSSOVER', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,coordination,shoulders}', '{jump rope}', 'A jump rope variation where the arms cross in front of the body during the jump, creating a crossed rope that you jump through. This advanced technique requires timing, coordination, and shoulder mobility. Excellent for developing rhythm and upper body coordination alongside cardiovascular fitness.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'JUMP_ROPE_JOG', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,endurance}', '{jump rope}', 'A jump rope style that mimics a jogging motion, alternating feet with each rope pass instead of jumping with both feet together. This variation is often easier to maintain for longer durations and more closely mimics running mechanics. Good for building cardiovascular endurance with lower impact than actual running.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'JUMPING_JACKS', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,full body,legs,shoulders}', '{bodyweight}', 'A classic calisthenics exercise starting from a standing position, jumping the feet wide while raising arms overhead, then returning to start. This full-body movement elevates heart rate, improves coordination, and serves as an excellent warm-up or cardio exercise. Simple yet effective for all fitness levels.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'SKI_MOGULS', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,legs,core,agility}', '{bodyweight}', 'A lateral jumping exercise mimicking the motion of skiing through moguls. Jump side-to-side over an imaginary line, often bringing knees up toward chest. This plyometric movement builds lateral power, core strength, cardiovascular fitness, and mimics skiing movement patterns.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'SPLIT_JACKS', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,legs,coordination}', '{bodyweight}', 'A jumping jack variation where legs split forward and back (like a scissors motion) instead of laterally. Alternate which leg goes forward with each jump. This movement pattern challenges coordination differently than standard jacks and builds cardiovascular endurance with a lunge-like leg pattern.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'SQUAT_JACKS', 'STRENGTH', '{legs,quads,glutes,cardio,squat pattern}', '{bodyweight}', 'A combination of jumping jacks and squats. Jump feet wide into a squat position, then jump feet together and stand. This variation significantly increases leg muscle engagement compared to regular jacks, building cardiovascular endurance while strengthening the quads, glutes, and overall lower body.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'TRIPLE_UNDER', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,power,coordination}', '{jump rope}', 'An extremely advanced jump rope technique where the rope passes under the feet three times in a single jump. This requires explosive jumping power, precise timing, and exceptional coordination. Triple unders are one of the most challenging jump rope skills and build remarkable ankle and calf power.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'WEIGHTED_BOB_AND_WEAVE_CIRCLE', 'STRENGTH', '{full body,cardio,agility,legs,power}', '{dumbbells}', 'Bob and weave circular movement performed while holding dumbbells or wearing a weight vest. The added resistance increases strength demands on the legs and core while maintaining cardiovascular benefits. Builds explosive power and fight-specific conditioning.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'WEIGHTED_CARDIO_CORE_CRAWL', 'STRENGTH', '{core,abs,shoulders,cardio,full body}', '{weight vest}', 'Core crawl performed with added resistance such as a weight vest or plate on the back. The additional load significantly increases strength demands on the core and shoulders while maintaining the cardiovascular challenge. Excellent for building work capacity and functional strength endurance.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'WEIGHTED_DOUBLE_UNDER', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,coordination,power}', '{weighted jump rope}', 'Double unders performed with a weighted jump rope (handles contain added weight). The heavier rope increases shoulder and grip demands while the movement pattern still requires explosive leg power. Builds upper body endurance alongside cardiovascular fitness and coordination.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'WEIGHTED_JUMP_ROPE', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,shoulders,grip,endurance}', '{weighted jump rope}', 'Standard jump rope performed with a weighted rope. The added weight in the handles or rope increases shoulder, forearm, and grip demands while maintaining the cardiovascular and calf-building benefits. Excellent for building total-body endurance and grip strength.');

An advanced variation that builds upper body endurance, coordination, and cardiovascular fitness.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'WEIGHTED_JUMP_ROPE_JOG', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,calves,shoulders,endurance}', '{weighted jump rope}', 'Alternating foot jump rope (jogging style) with a weighted rope.

More demanding on the core due to the added weight during the lateral jumps.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('CARDIO', 'WEIGHTED_SPLIT_JACKS', 'STRENGTH', '{cardio,legs,coordination,power}', '{dumbbells}', 'Split jacks performed while holding light dumbbells.

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('FLYE', 'CABLE_CROSSOVER', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,shoulders,isolation}', '{cable machine}', 'A chest isolation exercise using cable machines set at various heights. Bring the cables together in front of the body with a slight bend in the elbows, squeezing the pecs at peak contraction. The constant tension from cables and ability to adjust angles makes this excellent for targeting different areas of the chest. Can be performed high-to-low, low-to-high, or at chest level.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('FLYE', 'DECLINE_DUMBBELL_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,lower chest,shoulders,isolation}', '{dumbbells,bench}', 'A dumbbell flye performed on a decline bench (head lower than hips). The decline angle emphasizes the lower and outer pectorals. With arms extended and elbows slightly bent, lower the dumbbells out to the sides in an arc motion, then bring them back together. This isolation movement stretches the pecs through a full range of motion.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('FLYE', 'DUMBBELL_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,shoulders,isolation}', '{dumbbells,bench}', 'The classic chest isolation exercise performed lying on a flat bench. With a slight bend in the elbows, lower dumbbells out to the sides in an arc motion until you feel a stretch in the chest, then bring them back together. This movement isolates the pectoralis major and provides an excellent stretch. Focus on controlled movement and mind-muscle connection.');

VALUES ('FLYE', 'INCLINE_DUMBBELL_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,upper chest,shoulders,isolation}', '{dumbbells,bench}', 'A dumbbell flye performed on an incline bench (typically 15-45 degrees). The incline shifts emphasis to the upper chest (clavicular head). The flye motion provides a deep stretch and strong contraction in the upper pecs. Excellent for developing the often-underdeveloped upper chest and creating chest definition.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('FLYE', 'INCLINE_REVERSE_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{back,rear delts,upper back,shoulders}', '{dumbbells,bench}', 'A rear delt exercise performed lying face-down on an incline bench. With dumbbells hanging straight down, raise arms out to the sides in a reverse fly motion, squeezing the shoulder blades together. This targets the posterior deltoids, rhomboids, and middle trapezius. Essential for shoulder health and balancing pressing movements.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('FLYE', 'KETTLEBELL_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,shoulders,stability,isolation}', '{kettlebell,bench}', 'A chest flye performed with kettlebells instead of dumbbells. The offset weight distribution of kettlebells increases stability demands and provides a unique challenge to grip and wrist stability. The flye motion still targets the pecs but with added stabilizer engagement. Can be performed on flat, incline, or decline benches.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('FLYE', 'KNEELING_REAR_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{back,rear delts,upper back,shoulders}', '{dumbbells}', 'A rear delt exercise performed in a kneeling position, typically with the torso hinged forward. Raise dumbbells out to the sides in a reverse fly motion while maintaining a neutral spine. This position isolates the rear deltoids and upper back muscles. The kneeling position provides stability and prevents momentum from the lower body.');

VALUES ('FLYE', 'SINGLE_ARM_STANDING_CABLE_REVERSE_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{back,rear delts,shoulders,unilateral,stability}', '{cable machine}', 'A unilateral reverse flye using a cable machine. Standing and pulling the cable across the body targets the rear deltoid and upper back. The single-arm variation increases core anti-rotation demands and allows full focus on each side independently. Excellent for addressing imbalances and improving shoulder health.');

INSERT INTO garmin_exercises (exercise_category, exercise_name, type, tags, equipment, description)
VALUES ('FLYE', 'SWISS_BALL_DUMBBELL_FLYE', 'STRENGTH', '{chest,shoulders,core,stability,isolation}', '{dumbbells,swiss ball}', 'A dumbbell flye performed while lying on a swiss ball instead of a bench. The unstable surface significantly increases core and stabilizer activation while performing the chest flye motion. This variation challenges balance and coordination while still providing the chest stretch and isolation of traditional flyes. The instability limits the weight that can be used.');
